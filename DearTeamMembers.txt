Amir - make the form page To let people register (Step 1 of Specific Requirements)

Joe - take a profile Page where they can View and edit all this information

Enzo - Make Home Page ( Contain an easy way to enter food eaten, an Indicator of how many calories can consume for the rest of the day, and weight loss to this point) I (Dylan) can help with Ui I think this page should also have a place to log your weight loss or weight gain.

Dylan - Make the Database that will hold all this content.


If anyone objects to this Make proposals below, also if you wanna just get started, use placeholder Values until I actually set up the database
